# xy_plot_compare_js
An R program that writes interactive scatter plots that compares two data sets, in html5/canvas/javascript format

This project is very similar to <code>xy_plot_js</code>. It consists of an R program <code>xyplot_compare_js.R</code> that writes an interactive scatter plot in html5/canvas/javascript format. The R function will plot two datasets; the resulting scatter plot lets the user toggle between the datasets to easily compare them. The scatter plot is also interactive in that if the user does a mouse-over on a point, a popup label appears giving information about the point.

Note, <code>test_plot.html</code> is sample output from the R program (see the source code).
